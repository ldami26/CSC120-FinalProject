## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.


- **Overall Approach**: I broke the project into smaller tasks—design, coding, testing, and debugging each component sequentially.  
- **New Things Learned**: I learned how to handle random events, input validation, and modular programming using classes.  
- **Implemented Differently**: I would make encounters more dynamic, like adding deeper combat mechanics or trade options.  
- **If Unlimited Time**: I would add a combat system, branching storyline, graphics, and save/load functionality.  
- **Most Helpful Feedback**: Start small and simple — given by my instructor.  
- **Advice to Past Self**: Test components early, focus on functionality before complexity, and break tasks into clear milestones.
